Holes! allows users to identify potholes that should be repaired.
Based on their notoriety, potholes that are hated will rise through the ranks and be the most hated pothole of all time!
(which is an indication to Public Works that something should be done)
</p>

<p>
Tell us how you punctured a tire or how you change your travelling routes just to avoid potholes.
It's time to let the world know that Pittsburgh will not stand for potholes. 
</p>

<p>
Holes! is inspired by my friend, Vincent, who bemoans the road conditions of Pittsburgh. Being a busy bureaucratic organisation,
Public Works has better things to do than to fill in holes that reappear every year anyway.
Commuters would know road conditions better and focus Public Works'
attention on the most pressing potholes.
</p>

<p>
Holes! is a reference to a book by Louis Sachar and has been made into a movie.
